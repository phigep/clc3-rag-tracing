# clc3-rag-tracing
This repo contains all the information and code for our semester project in cloud computing.

## What is the high-level goal of your project?
The high level goal of our project is a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline (prototypical) that runs on kubernetes with included tracing of requests, retrieved contexts and generated answers. It should allow for local LLMs to be used (vLLM), which might help with scalability and security. 
A scalable and understandable (tracing!) RAG pipeline helps in refining the retrieval **and** generation part.
